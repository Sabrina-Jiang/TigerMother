        <h1>A day in life of students</h1>
        <iframe class="section-1" src="visualize/bubble.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>

        <p>This is a visualization for showing how a student spend their day, by their different races. We randomly
            picked 100 people’s data for each race in our dataset for this stimulation. There are several components in
            this graph, which is: <i class="highlight">the time on the top of the graph, three buttons in the middle
                that used for adjusting
                the speed of the stimulation, the reset button to restart the stimulation.</i>
        </p>

                    <p>In this visualization, a dot represents a single person. The y axis of the graph represents the
                        activities that the students are doing. If a student is changing from one activity to another,
                        the dot will move to the cluster that he is currently in. If the student is doing homework or
                        taking a class at this time, the dot will be colored, the color is also representing its
                        race.</p>

                    <p>This visualization gave us an intuitive view of the time schedule of a student, Asian students do
                        pay more attention to its homework during the whole day, however, since the number of sample is
                        relatively small, we infer much information from it. We have to go for some statistical
                        indicators.</p>

        <p>There are two visualizations included in this section,
            we are trying to infer <i class="highlight">whether Asian parents have impact on the students studying
                time.</i>

                    <p>The visualization on the left shows the average time of each student’s activity, by their
                        different races and education level. The y axis represents different activities, besides, the x
                        axis is the average time.</p>

                    <p>The visualization on the right indicated the percentage of students that student on study, which
                        is colored by orange, and the percentage of mother spend their times on education activities
                        with their children, which is colored by green, the x axis represents the time period.</p>

                    <p>Compared with the two visualization, high school Asian students spend relatively less time on
                        studying or doing work, on the contrast, college Asian students pay more attention on working or
                        studying. However, the current study have not yet to find significant evidence to support or
                        refute the concern that Asian mother are more tend to spend much time with children. </p>

        <h1>how parents spend their times</h1>
        <iframe class="section-3" src="visualize/section3.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        <p>This section mainly focus on <i class="highlight">how much time the mothers by different races spend time on
            their children</i>, and will they push on their studies (spending more time on education activities with
            children), We used several types of bar charts to make comparison.
        </p>

        <div class="marker-container">

                    <p>In this visualization, different bars are representing the races, different colors are used to
                        indicate the activity of the mother, while the y axis measures the percentage, or average time
                        of the specific activity. We may clicked the button on the top-right to change the type of bar
                        chart with transition animations.</p>

                <div class="des">
                    <p>What we can tell in this graph is that, Asian mothers will prefer spend less time on their work,
                        and spend more time on education activities with children instead, but this difference on time
                        is not significant (only few percents)

                        of teaching their children. But if this way of education efficient, we can give any inference in
